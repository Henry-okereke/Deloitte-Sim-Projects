# Deloitte-Sim-Projects
Welcome to my repository showing two Simulation Projects i did with Deloitte Australia through Forage. The simulation projects exposed me to real life projects or problem points; that tested my problem solving skills and helped sharpen my creativity and analytical skills. The inherent insights from the projects reinforced my quest to always contribute to solving business problems through data analytics. 

## Task List

Here's an overview of the tasks or projects I worked on during my internship:

## Task 1
The first project is the Analysis of a Telemetry Data; where i used Tableau to analyze the data and built a dashboard of two charts; using the first chat as a filter to the second chat.
