# Telemetry Data Analysis

### Task 1

Using a data unification algorithm, the tech team at our client, Daikibo, has converted all telemetry data collected from its 4 factories:
•	Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
•	Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
•	Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
•	Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 mins. Daikibo has been collecting this data for one month (May 2021) and they've shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

### Business Questions

The reason the client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

1.	In which location did machines break the most?
2.	What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

### Data Dictionary

Here's a brief description of the dataset columns:

| Column Name    | Description                             |
| ------------   | -----------------------------------     |
| Document Index | Unique identifier for each flower       |
| Status         | Unicode character string                |
| Temporature    | Double-precision floating-point number  |
| Device ID      | Unicode character string                |
| Device Type    | Unicode character string                |
| Area           | Unicode character string                |
| Country        | Unicode character string                |
| Factory        | Unicode character string                |
| Section        | Unicode character string                |
| Timestamp      | Double-precision floating-point number  |
| Unhealthy      | Calculated Field                        |

	
### Steps Taken to Analyze Data and answer Business Question

1. I used TABLEAU in analyzing and insight visualizing 
2. I Downloaded the daikibo-telemetry-data.json.zip file -> unzip -> and import it into Tableau
3. I Created a calculated measure field called "Unhealthy" with a value of 10 for every unhealthy status (representing 10 mins of potential down time since the previous message).
4. I used this formular: IF [Status] = "unhealthy" THEN 10 ELSE 0 END
5. In the existing sheet, i created a bar chart called “Down Time per Factory”; using the "unhealthy" measure field and fatory field
6. I Created a new sheet with a new bar chart called “Down Time per Device Type”. using the "unhealthy" measure field and device field
7. Finally, I Created a Dashboard with the 2 previous sheets and set the first chart to be used as a filter (selecting a factory in the first chart shows only the down time of the machines in this factory in the second chart)

### Insights

Aftre the analysis; the following insights were derived;
1.	It was discovered that Machines broke down the most in the Daikibo factory in Seiko. 
2.	And it was also observed that the machine that broke down the most in the Daikibo factory is the Laserwelder with 480 downtime.
