TASK BACKGROUND

After a worrisome number of internal complaints about gender inequality in terms of salary, Daikibo Industrials wanted our team to help them investigate.

The Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify “level of gender pay equality” for most job roles within the company, in all company locations. 
The Forensics lead then directed that i finish the job.

The Forencic team have initially processed all data on employee compensation and generated an Excel file containing 3 columns:
1.	Factory
2.	Job Role
3.	Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)

## BUSINESS QUESTION

Daikibo Industrials wants to ascertain the level of gender inequality in terms of salary; and ranked interms of Fair, Unfair, and Highly Discriminative.

## STEPS OF ANALYSIS

1. I Created a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score into 3 types, and assigning treshholds to each; 
1. Fair (+-10)
2. Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
3. Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)

2. I wrote the following logic on the created 4th column cell (replicating it to other cells) to automatically sort the data according to the equality treshhold score.

=IF(AND(C2>=-10,C2<=10),"Fair",IF(AND(C2>=-19, C2<=19),"Unfair",IF(AND(C2<=-20),"Highly Discriminative",IF(AND(C2>=20),"Highly Discriminative",""))))

## RESULT

we summarized the analysis using =COUNTIF(D:D, "Highly Discriminative"), =COUNTIF(D:D, "Unfair"), =COUNTIF(D:D, "Fair").
Summarily, we discovered; 9 Highly Discrinative cases, 9 Unfair cases, and 19 Fair cases. And that these cases were scarttered across different factories.
